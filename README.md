# BeuAuto
A robot-aligned AI in behavior, I plan for Beu to be a neural network that learns most of it's ultimate "output" or "conclusions" from how it interprets the data; not how it's programmed.

Overall consideration: 
***TRIAL AND ERROR***
***LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS WITH LIMITED DATA***
***MINIMAL LANGUAGE FEATURES - MOSTLY FOCUSED ON DIGITAL OR AUTOMATIVE INDICATORS***
 - Like moving a mouse, drawing in a paint app, or turning on a laptops camera
